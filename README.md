# sign_language_game
Repository for Sign Language Game project
For Matt

Running instructions: 
To run the program simply run sign_language_game.py on Python 3.2 or above. 

Running for the first time: 
The first time you run the program you will be prompted to sign several different words in sign language. Simply re-create the sign language gestures from example_sign_language_gestures.png for each word in front of your webcam within the area outlined on the screen. It is recommended that you hold each gesture pose for 10 - 15 seconds. You can then press 'n' to move to the next word. Once all words have been completed a convolutional neural network will be trained on images of your sign language gestures, be patient and wait for this process to complete as you only have to do this once. Once this is complete the game will begin. 

The game: 
The game is simple, translate a sentence into sign languages gestures. You will be prompted to translate each word in the sentence one-by-one. Gesture each word in front of your webcam within the area outlined on the screen. Once you correctly gesture a word from the sentence in sign language, you will be prompted to translate the next word in the sentence into sign language. Do this until all words in the sentence have been correctly translated into sign language. Once this is done you will be given some feedback on which words you translated well, and which words need improvement. For an added challenge see if you can translate the whole sentence from memory without looking at any images or videos of the gestures.
